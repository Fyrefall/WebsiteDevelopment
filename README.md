# WebsiteDevelopment

A simple project which will be used as a basis to improve all other web based projects.

Languages:
Html
JavaScript
SCSS

Code Editor: VS Code

Problems:
- When clicking the "Watch Sass" button, it creates a new styles.css and style.css.map file within the scss folder instead of dist.
- When the site is live the page seems to not obey the styles detailed in _header.scss... probably because of the above problem.
